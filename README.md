# 👋 Hi there, I'm Andrii Saiak

I'm a **software engineer** specializing in **blockchain systems, backend architecture, and infrastructure automation**.  
My work focuses on building **secure, scalable, and event-driven** applications for modern distributed environments.

---

### 🧠 Professional Summary

I have deep experience in designing and implementing **multi-service architectures** that integrate **cryptography, blockchain logic, and cloud-native infrastructure**.  
My goal is to create systems that are **resilient, observable, and verifiably secure** — from key management to transaction execution.

I work across the full stack — from protocol-level integrations to user-facing applications — with a strong emphasis on **security, performance, and developer experience**.
